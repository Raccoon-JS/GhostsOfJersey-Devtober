Gender: Male (Trans)
Bio:
Ashley was born in Newark like Bernard. He grew up in a strict, traditionalist family. He has to become like an ideal wife for a man. Because he was assigned female at birth, he kept a secret that he desired to become a man like his spouse Bernard, but that made him more anxious and sickly. His lack of self-trust and self-esteem made him feel weak. His only way of dealing with his weakness is to be as much as himself, and having a sense of self-control.
