Formatting note: I figure there is a variable that tells the game who is playing. Text blocks preceded by “both” should be in both protagonists’ stories.

Both:
My skin feels warm. It feels like the sun is glowing on me, but from every angle. I am lying on something immensely soft. The air smells sweet, without any of the earthy tones that would have been in the forest. Everything is perfect.
I move my fingers. The only thing covering me is a thin cotton shift. My eyes open. The room feels ethereal, seemingly having no end. I can see another person far away, but the room has a strange mist in it, and I can’t see who the other person is.
I run my hands over my body.

Ashley:
Breasts. I no longer have breasts. Where there once were two apple-sized mounds of flesh, there was now only smooth skin. With their absence, I could see down my own body with ease. I could see my slim torso and weak legs. There was a lump on my pelvis. I have no need to look at it. I already know what it is, and it is mine.
It is the manhood I never thought I could have.

Bernard:
My neck feels firm. My chest feels strong. The scars on my arms and legs have disappeared. There is no longer any evidence of my time in the war, or even from when I fell off a wagon as a child. I am complete, except for one thing. Ashley is not here.
Perhaps Ashley is. There is another person in the room. If there is any chance that is my love, I have to go see.

Both:
I stand up. The floor feels like a new carpet. I slowly walk to the other person. With every step, my heart rises. It has to be. The other person stepped through the mist, and I can see clearly. It is [othername].

Ashley:
He looks less weary. There are no powder burns on his hands or scars on his arms from combat. His skin is free of blemishes. There isn’t even a single gray hair on his head. His appearance is flawless. He looks at me with a careful expression, taking in my form. The only other time he looked at me that way was on our wedding night.

Bernard:
She looks perfect. Or, I should say, he looks perfect. Despite the new addition to his lower half and the lack of curves, Ashley still looks like Ashley. He still has that thin build, that long hair, and those beautiful eyes. There is a confidence in his eyes that I have never seen. This body is new, but it fits him so well.
Both:
We stand silently for a while, just looking at each other. What could we say? We had just died. That alone is enough to comprehend.

Ashley:
Bernard breaks the silence. “You really are Ashley after all.”
“You are the Bernard you have always been,” I murmur.
“You…” He searches for the correct words. “You look like you were always meant to be like this.”
“I think I was. It feels right. Though you might not see it that way. I might have gained some anatomy, but I lost something too.” I blush, remembering the times I had rolled up a stocking and put it in my drawers.
Bernard grabs my arm. “Marriage is between a man and his wife. You may be male now, but you are still my wife.”

Bernard:
I broke the silence. “You really are Ashley after all.”
“You are the Bernard you have always been,” Ashley murmured.
“You…” I search for the correct words. “You look like you were always meant to be like this.”
“I think I was. It feels right. Though you might not see it that way. I might have gained some anatomy, but I lost something too.” Ashley blushes.
I grab his shoulder, wanting to reassure him. “Marriage is between a man and his wife. You may be male now, but you are still my wife.”

Both:
“Is nothing going to change?”
“Absolutely nothing.”
“Except I will not bleed as much. Thank God.”
We held hands. I start to look around the area. I had thought that we were in a place that was flat, but now the mist was fading. We could see buildings rising through them. Hand in hand, we walk towards them.
The first building we see looks like a warm, inviting bakery. A sign above the door reads “The Desired Bakery”. Buns and breads sit in the windows. An inviting scent creeps under the door. We enter, and a small bell rings. There are all types of bread, buns, and rolls, including some that I have never seen before. Each one has a stamp on it.
An incredibly tall man stands by the counter. He wears a long cloth that wraps around his body and a smock that covers his chest. His muscular arms told of the hard work that he had done. When he sees us, he smiles.
“Would you happen to be Mr. Ashley Bailey and Mr. Bernard Baily?” The man’s voice is low and sweet. He has a strange accent.

Ashley:
It tickles me to hear him use my real name. “Yes, we are.”

Bernard:
Ashley has the widest smile I have seen in a very long time. “Yes, we are.”

Both:
“Excellent.” He takes three boxes from behind the counter. “I have some clothes for you.”
The first two boxes contain a full suit and a smock. The suit is made out of a beautiful fabric. The third box contained the gun we had used in our fight, but there were no bullets.
“In my centuries here, I have never understood why people arrive here in their underwear and their clothes arrive here. Come inside. You can change upstairs.” He nods.
The man leads us up a set of wooden stairs to the second storey. As he walks, he introduces himself as Julius, a former centurion from the Roman army. He had wanted to open a bakery when he was done his service, but he was attacked in the middle of the night by “daemones”.

Bernard:
“Did it have wings, hooves, and a horse’s head?” I ask.
“Yes, it did.”
Ashley remarks, “The same creatures killed us, but we called them the Jersey Devils.”

Ashley:
“Did it have wings, hooves, and a horse’s head?” Bernard asks.
“Yes, it did.”
I remark, “The same creatures killed us, but we called them the Jersey Devils.”

Both:
Julius grimaces. “That wasn’t the real Jersey Devil. He never does his own dirt work. Those were just his minions.”
“Have you seen the real Jersey Devil?” we ask at the same time.
“No, never. I’ve only heard rumors. I have no desire to fight. He may be in the Spirit World, or he may be in the Mortal World. Honestly, I would not worry about it. You are the new owners of this bakery. Your home is here.”
He brings us to a small apartment with a double bed, a wash-basin and a gigantic wardrobe. Sunlight, or something like it, streams in through a window. We change into our new clothes.

Ashley:
“Pardon?” I cannot believe this man. “We can’t possibly be the owners. We just arrived.”
Julius looks directly into my eyes. “I have lived here for more than a thousand years. It is time for me to return to the mortal world.”
Bernard adds, “We do not know how to make these breads.”

Bernard:
“Pardon?” Ashley looks incredulous. “We can’t possibly be the owners. We just arrived.”
Julius looks directly into her eyes with a steely gaze. “I have lived here for more than a thousand years. It is time for me to return to the mortal world.”
I add, “We do not know how to make these breads.”

Both:
“You know how to make it in your heart. I did.” Julius took off his smock. “And now, I am done.”
Julius drops the smock on the floor and begins to leave. We ask him what we’re meant to do here, but he just shrugs and walks back down the stairs. We are completely alone.
If this is our house, we may as well know what is in it. We decide to search through our new home. The wardrobe is empty. Downstairs, there is a full commercial kitchen and a storage area filled with barrels of raw materials. Roman paraphernalia hangs on the walls. Everything is neat and orderly. It does not feel like home now, but it could become quite cozy.
Between the walk, the fight, and the dying, we are exhausted. We put a closed sign in the window. We head back upstairs.

Ashley:
Although I want to go to sleep, Bernard seems agitated. He bites his lip. He starts to examine the wardrobe again.
He knocks on the back of the wardrobe and grunts. He slides his fingers around the back.
“Ashley! Come and help me open this.” I run over as soon as I can.
I am able to grab the back and pull it open. Bernard gasps. Neither of us expected this. 

Bernard:
Something bothers me about the wardrobe. Julius had lived here for an incredibly long time, but there were no clothes inside it. Why would he keep something so large that he did not need?
I knock on the back of the wardrobe. It sounds hollow. There is a gap in the back that is slightly too small for my fingers.
“Ashley! Come and help me open this.” My heart is racing.
He is able to grab the back and pull it open. I gasp. I never expected this.

Both:
Secreted in the wardrobe, there were two glistening swords, several daggers, a bow, a quiver of arrows, and a full set of armor. It was everything a centurion would have needed. Julius may have not wanted to fight, but if we learned to use these, we could destroy the Jersey Devil. He would not hurt another soul.
We had nothing to lose, after all. We were already dead.
