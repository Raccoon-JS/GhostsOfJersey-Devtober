	### PROLOGUE ###
	g.write("The breeze shook the pine boughs overhead as the young Mrs. Mary Baily, known to friends as \"Ashley\", wandered up the trail. With each step, her lungs took in the healing air. Far from the miasma of Newark, she hoped that the sweet forest's scent would allow her body the rest it needed before she could return to her everyday life.\n\nHer darling husband, Bernard, was a few steps ahead of her. He pushed shrub branches to the side to allow Ashley passage through the trail. It was his duty to protect her from troubles along the way, whether they be stray creatures or sharp thorns. The war had given him enough of a chance to fight, but saving his wife would be a different type of battle.","res://images/Berkeley_Heights_NJ_woods_trans.png")
	g.write("At last, they arrived at a small clearing. Ashley lifted her walking-skirts so as to avoid the dust and brambles before sitting on a log. The sun's rays passed between the trees, catching the light of her alabaster skin. Bernard took a place beside her.\n\n\"How is the forest treating you?\" Bernard asked, entwining his fingers with her slim fingers.\n\nAshley smiled, a slight glow upon her cheeks. \"It's treating me well, although my legs do tire after such a journey. Legs as strong as yours would never do so.\"","res://images/Berkeley_Heights_NJ_woods_trans.png")
