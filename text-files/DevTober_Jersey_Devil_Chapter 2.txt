Both: 
A few weeks had passed since we first made the plan to get revenge on the Jersey Devil. We trained every night, improving our bodies and our minds so that we could survive an encounter with him. When we were strong enough, we would be able to defeat him.
Through our work at the Desired Bakery, we discovered that we were not the first victims of the Jersey Devil. There were many others. All had travelled to the Pine Barrens, and all met an unfortunate fate.
The first person we had met was Sasha, a factory girl from somewhere in Eastern Europe. One of those border towns that changes countries whenever a war ends. SheÅfd moved to America with little more than the clothes on he back and a dream. She found work in a factory. Even in the afterlife, her smile can dwarf the sun. She comes in for an apple pie once a week.
ÅgThis is only place where I can get pie like old country!Åh she said once.

Ashley:
I still think it tastes like the apple pie my mother used to make, and her family came over before New Jersey existed.

Bernard:
Ashley thinks it tastes like her motherÅfs recipe.

Both:
Most of our visitors arenÅft like Sasha. TheyÅfve never heard of the Jersey Devil, much less seen him. Some of them have never heard of New Jersey, or even of America. They tell us about their journeys in life and the afterlife. It appears that the Spirit World is incredibly large. We have not seen much of the Spirit World because we have spent most of our spare time preparing to fight.

Ashley:
I am managing the front as Bernard is putting a fresh batch of cinnamon rolls in the oven. The bakery is filled with the sweet scent of cooking. The lunch rush is coming, and we need to be ready.
A tall, slim man in priestÅfs robes walks into the bakery. IÅfve never seen him before. There is an unsettlingly cold look in his eyes.
I grin at him. ÅgGood morning, sir. What would you like today?Åh
ÅgThe Jersey Devil killed you,Åh he remarks in a monotone voice.
ÅgThÅc that is not a menu item. Can I interest you in a cherry tart?Åh
ÅgAh.Åh He grunts. ÅgAn angel cake, please.Åh
I get him one as Bernard returns. His apron is covered in flour.
Bernard leans on the counter. ÅgThe Jersey Devil did kill us, and now we sell baked goods. Why do you ask?Åh

Bernard:
I slide another tray of cinnamon rolls into a warm oven. The room is filled with the scents of cooking. The lunch rush is coming, and weÅfre not quite ready. Ashley is at the front, watching for customers.
The bell rings as someone walks in.
AshleyÅfs honey-sweet voice echoes from the front. ÅgGood morning, sir. What would you like today?Åh
ÅgThe Jersey Devil killed you,Åh responds a monotone male.
ÅgThÅc that is not a menu item. Can I interest you in a cherry tart?Åh
ÅgAh.Åh He grunts. ÅgAn angel cake, please.Åh
I head to the front as Ashley gets it. If heÅfs going to give Ashley and I problems, I do not want him around.
I lean on the counter, giving him a non-verbal warning. ÅgThe Jersey Devil did kill us, and now we sell baked goods. Why do you ask?Åh

Both:
The man straightens up, smoothing his black priestÅfs smock. ÅgI have been chasing the Jersey Devil since I was thirteen. That monster has evaded me and crushed my soul. I thought I, Josef, would be the one to defeat him. I left my seminary school to study every hair on that ugly monsterÅfs head. Every day I would analyse his movements, trying to understand him. Trying to track him.
After a decade of study, I went to the heart of the Pine Barron. I had memorised my notes about how he moved and how he thought. I knew that I could defeat him.
And yet, I failed. His minions killed me as if I was nothing. I had the knowledge, but none of the skill.Åh
ÅgHow many minions were there?Åh
ÅgI think there were fifty.Åh

Ashley:
Bernard stares, shocked. ÅgWe only saw two of them. I killed one of them.Åh
ÅgAnd I managed to kill the other one,Åh I add.

Bernard:
I stare at Josef. ÅgWe only saw two of them. I killed one of them.Åh
ÅgAnd I managed to kill the other one,Åh Ashley adds.

Both:
Josef nods. ÅgThat makes sense with what other people have said.Åh
ÅgPardon?Åh We say at the same time.
ÅgI run a monthly meeting for people who have encountered the Jersey Devil. This monthÅfs meeting is tonight. Would you two be able to come?Åh

Ashley:
ÅgThat would be an absolute delight!Åh I feel so excited to meet all of those people who had died the same way we did. ÅgMeeting others, I mean.Åh
Bernard agrees. ÅgI will have to bring some paper and take notes.Åh


Bernard:
ÅgThat would be an absolute delight!Åh Ashley grins from ear to ear. ÅgMeeting others, I mean.Åh
I would love to go. ÅgI will have to bring some paper and take notes.Åh

Both:
We suggest that this month, he could host the meeting at the bakery. Josef agrees. He leaves with a smile on his face.
After work, we prepare for this meeting. We set up five chairs in the sitting room. We make coffee, tea, and all sorts of treats for our guests. Perhaps the guests will be similar to the Josef, students who were trying to learn about the devil.
The motley group of people arrive all at once. Josef is the first one in, taking the lead of the whole affair. Behind him is a man with a huge, muscular frame who seems to fill the doorway and takes up two seats. We almost miss the person in a Puritan shirtwaist and skirt behind him. A Chinese man takes a seat by the window, and a dark-skinned man and woman sit beside his chair. Sasha is the last person to enter the room. We fetch boxes for Sasha and the darker couple to sit on.
Josef begins the meeting. His voice fills the room as if we were in a narthex. ÅgWelcome to the Jersey Devil support group.  This month, we have two new members. These are Ashley and Bernard Bailey. Bernard used to be a soldier in the United States Army. Ashley was a homemaker. Now they work in this bakery.Åh
ÅgWhy were you a homemaker?Åh the incredibly tall man asks.
ÅgI used to be a lady.Åh
After that, introductions begin. The huge man is Montgomery, who had been attacked while trying to find his husbandÅfs favourite flowers in the Pine Barrens. The Puritan is Marlene, who died in the Pine Barrens with their husband, but their husband was so uncomfortable with his spiritÅfs appearance that he hid himself away. The Chinese man is Li, who died in a war against the Mongols after a stray minion attacked him. The darker-skinned couple are Victor and Mabel, who called each other Ågslave siblingsÅh. Victor had died in what the plantation owner called an accident. Mabel died while trying to escape to freedom through the Pine Barrens. They reunited in the afterlife.

Ashley:
ÅgWe were thinking that we might fight the Jersey Devil,Åh Bernard comments.
The room quickly voiced their disapproval. They had tried to kill him before. It hadnÅft worked.
ÅgWe were thinking about it,Åh I add with a masculine firmness, ÅgBut we realise that there is no way that we can accomplish such a task on our own. We would all have to work together. We could have had wonderful lives if it were not for that devil. Together, we can make sure that nobody else will have to deal with the shock of losing a loved one to him.Åh
Bernard stood up. ÅgThere are eight of us. They canÅft kill us all.Åh

Both:
Montgomery stood. ÅgI will fight with you, brother.Åh
Victor and Mabel raised their hands. ÅgAs will we.Åh
Sasha grinned. ÅgI may not be able to fight, but I will help in whatever way I can.Åh
Li stood with such rapidness that he knocked over his snack. ÅgI want to fight too.Åh
One by one, the rest of the group agrees. We will take on this monster together. Every day after work, we gather in a courtyard in the Spirit World. We exchange tactics from wars and adversity, creating a complex tapestry of moves. Those of us who would rather not fight directly lead a care team, practicing treatments found in JosefÅfs library. Every day, we learn something new, coming one step closer to winning.
